# Trinity issue tracker
This repository is for creating/discussing issues.  
On github I try to maintain high professionalism, when making comments or new issues please only share helpful information.  
Comments like "lol", "hahaha" or other messages that aren't helpful to the conversation are not appreciated (use reactions if possible).  
Making comments like this will get your messages deleted and possibly blocked from the Trinity organization.  
If you do have helpful information or suggestions feel free to head to the issues tab on github and help me out.  

## Exploits
DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT report exploits here.  
If you find an exploit or a different bug that fundamentally breaks Trinity (alter data in an unauthorized way, crash Trinity, execute commands without proper permission) please report this in private through discord.  
Failure to comply with this rule will earn you an immediate block from the organization.  
Exploits and other bugs that fundamentally break Trinity need to be handled with respect and confidentiality to cause the least amount of damage possible.  
You can report these issues by making a ticket in the [support discord server](https://discord.gg/RGD8fkD).

## Area labels
There are multiple labels that are used at the issues tab.  
The area labels are for specifying which part of Trinity will be modified or is affected.  
Please refrain from adding these area labels as some issues might affect a different area then you might expect.  
Once the api is public you can add the api label to your issue if it has to do with the api. (Yes there will be a public api)

## Milestones
You can check the current update progress by checking the milestones tab under issues.  
It will show the amount of open issues and closed issues.  
Please do not add any issues to these milestones.  
I will decide what milestone the issue should be added to.
