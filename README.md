# Trinity issue tracker
This repository is for creating/discussing issues.  
On github I try to maintain high professionalism, when making comments or new issues please only share helpful information.  
Comments like "lol", "hahaha" or other messages that aren't helpful to the conversation are not appreciated (use reactions if possible).  
Making comments like this will get your messages deleted and possibly blocked from the Trinity organization.  
If you do have helpful information or suggestions feel free to head to the issues tab on github and help me out.  

## Exploits
DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT report exploits here.  
If you find an exploit or a different bug that fundamentally breaks Trinity (alter data in an unauthorized way, crash Trinity, execute commands without proper permission) please report this in private through discord.  
Failure to comply with this rule will earn you an immediate block from the organization.  
Exploits and other bugs that fundamentally break Trinity need to be handled with respect and confidentiality to cause the least amount of damage possible.  
You can report these issues by making a ticket in the [support discord server](https://discord.gg/RGD8fkD).

## Milestones
You can check the current update progress by checking the milestones tab under issues.
